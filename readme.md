# AgriLife Gravity Forms Inventory Extension

This extension builds on the GW_Inventory class developed by GravityWiz by automatically adding options to the Single Product and Number fields which instantiate that class's functionality.

It is based on two class files by David Smith of gravitywiz.com: GW_Inventory and GW_Notification_Event.
